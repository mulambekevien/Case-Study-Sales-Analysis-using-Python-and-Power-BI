# Case-Study-Sales-Analysis-using-Python-and-Power-BI
Here are the steps i followed in the Analysis of the dataset:
- I used Python in the data cleaning, feature Engineering, Data manipulation and Visualization.
- I also used PowerBI to do the data cleaning and created a dashboard with it.

#### 1.Data Cleaning
I did data cleaning by identifying any missing values, outliers and incorrect datatypes

#### 2. Feature Engineering
I added the required columns needed like Total Sales, Month_Year and others that i needed.

#### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
I explored different visualizations and created them.

#### 4. Advanced Analysis
I did some advanced Data Analysis like Customer Segmentation, Clustering using k means, forecasting, anomay detection and correlation.

#### 5. Insights and Recommendation
I then listed the recommendations and Insights from the analysis and later went on to create a dashboard in Power BI for  presentation.
